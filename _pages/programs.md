# Programs for Council 7186 - Apex NC

__We are men who lead, serve, protect and defend, whether we are giving out Coats for Kids, lending a hand in disaster relief efforts, supporting local pregnancy centers by donating ultrasound machines or providing top-quality financial products. Find out more about what we do.__


## [Family][family]


Father McGivney sought to strengthen the bonds of families in his parish and the Knights of Columbus. These programs, created for families by families, help us to live this call.

## [Faith][faith]


Our goal is to strengthen men and their families in the Catholic faith. Formation in our faith goes beyond mere facts or religious practice to an authentic connection with a loving God and his son Jesus Christ.

## [Community][community]
Knights are called to serve others. Our first principle is Charity â€“ at home with our families and in our communities. When Knights of Columbus members come together they accomplish great things.

## [Life][life]
The Knights of Columbus vigorously defends the dignity of each human being at every stage of life.
