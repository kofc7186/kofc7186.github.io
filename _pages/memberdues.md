## Custom Amounts
If you'd like to pay a different amount than the predefined options above, please follow [this link](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/V6ZXN4Y2C6PXG) to pay the council via PayPal.

### Transaction Fees
To use PayPal, the council pays fees in order to process the credit card transactions. We kindly request you increase your payment to cover these fees so that
the council does not use its operating funds to cover this fee. To calculate the total amount to pay, please use the following formula, where `D` is the amount you'd like the council
to receive *after* paying the PayPal fees (0.50 + 2.03%):

$$\texttt{pay} = 1.0203 \times D + 0.50$$
