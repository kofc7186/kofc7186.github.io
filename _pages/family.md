# Family Programs and Initiatives

Families are the foundation of society and are at the core of the Knights of Columbus. With this in mind, councils regularly sponsor activities that allow families to spend time together in volunteer activities, faith initiatives and social events. In addition, the Knights of Columbus regularly recognizes the importance of the family and outstanding families. In addition, since its beginnings, the Order has always stood ready to help protect the widows and orphans of its members.  Apex Council 7186 is very active with the following activities:
